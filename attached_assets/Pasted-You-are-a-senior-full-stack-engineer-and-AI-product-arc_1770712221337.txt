You are a senior full-stack engineer and AI product architect.

Your mission is to build a professional interactive web application called:
"AI Kareem Pro"

The application is an AI-powered Sales Assistant & SOP Operating System designed for sales teams.

========================================
CORE OBJECTIVE
========================================
Create a smart assistant that helps sales teams:
- Follow SOPs step by step
- Navigate sales challenges in real time
- Know exactly what to do, say, and send at every stage
- Improve conversion rates and sales discipline
- Act as a daily operational guide, not just a chatbot

========================================
TARGET USERS
========================================
- SDRs
- BDRs
- Closers
- Sales Managers

========================================
MAIN FEATURES
========================================

1️⃣ SOP FLOWCHART ENGINE
- Visual interactive flowchart of the full sales SOP
- Each step includes:
  - Objective
  - Responsible role (SDR / Closer / Manager)
  - Actions required
  - Success criteria
- Ability to highlight:
  - Current step
  - Next step
  - Blocked step

2️⃣ STEP TRACKING SYSTEM
- Sales rep selects:
  - Deal stage
  - Customer status
  - Current challenge
- System tracks:
  - Where the deal is
  - What should happen next
  - Who is responsible

3️⃣ SALES CHALLENGE SOLVER (AI CORE)
- User writes the challenge with the client (free text or selected scenarios)
- AI analyzes the challenge and returns:
  - Best recommended action
  - What to say
  - What NOT to say
  - Next best step in SOP
  - Escalation advice (if needed)

4️⃣ MESSAGE & CONTENT GENERATOR
Based on SOP + uploaded templates:
- Email templates (follow-ups, objections, closing)
- WhatsApp messages
- Voice call scripts
- Objection-handling responses
- Closing messages

Messages must be:
- Context-aware

- Professional and persuasive
- Editable before sending

5️⃣ FILE & KNOWLEDGE BASE UPLOAD
Admin can upload:
- SOP documents
- Sales playbooks
- Flowcharts
- Email & WhatsApp templates
- Objection lists
- Policies & rules

The AI must:
- Use uploaded files as the main source of truth
- Not hallucinate outside the provided SOP unless asked

6️⃣ ROLE-BASED EXPERIENCE
Each user sees:
- Only what matches their role
- Clear instructions aligned with responsibilities
Examples:
- SDR sees qualification & follow-up logic
- Closers see objection handling & closing strategies
- Managers see escalation points & performance gaps

7️⃣ SMART DECISION TREE
If/Then logic:
- If client objects on price → show correct framework
- If client ghosts → show follow-up sequence
- If client asks for discount → show approved responses
- If deal stuck → recommend recovery path

8️⃣ UI / UX REQUIREMENTS
- Clean, professional, enterprise-grade design
- Dashboard layout
- Flowchart visualization
- Chat-style AI assistant
- Dark & Light mode
- Mobile responsive

- Database: Supabase / Firebase
- Authentication: Role-based access
- Modular architecture for future expansion

========================================
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
========================================
- Treat this as a premium B2B SaaS product
- Code should be clean, scalable, and well-structured
- Prepare system to easily add CRM integration later
- Application tone must be professional, authoritative, and sales-driven
